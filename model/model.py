        #     param.requires_grad = False

        # Example: Get the number of output features from the detector's backbone
        # This part is highly dependent on the specific YOLO model structure
        # and how you intend to add the classification head.
        # For simplicity, let's assume we extract features after detection.

        # Placeholder for an action classification head
        # This head would take features from detected human bounding boxes
        # and classify the action.
        # The actual input size will depend on how features are extracted.
        # For example, if using RoIAlign and a small CNN or MLP:
        # self.action_classifier = nn.Sequential(
        #     nn.Linear(in_features=SOME_FEATURE_SIZE, out_features=256),

        #     nn.Linear(in_features=256, out_features=num_actions)
        # )

        # For now, we'll focus on using YOLO for detection.
        # The strategy for action classification needs to be refined:
        # 1. Train YOLO to detect humans (1 class). Then, for each detected human,
        #    crop the image and pass it to a separate action classifier.
        # 2. Modify YOLO to have `num_actions` output classes directly, where each class
        #    represents an action (e.g., standing_person, sitting_person). This requires
        #    reformatting labels and retraining YOLO.
        # 3. Use YOLO for detection and add a custom classification head that operates
        #    on features from the detected regions.

        #     - Pass the cropped region/features to the action classifier.

        # The actual implementation will depend on the chosen strategy for action classification.
